# Approved seminars
This is a list of seminars that have been approved for supplementation of the Rudbeck and Svedberg seminars.

## Background
PhD students at the Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology are required to attend 30 Rudbeck or Svedberg seminars.
Unfortunately, these have been cancelled because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Therefore, PhD students are required to attend other seminar series, which have to be approved by their supervisors.
Below, you find a list of approved seminars to make it easier for you to find appropriate seminars.
