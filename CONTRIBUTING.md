Submissions can only be accepted from PhD students at Uppsala University's Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology.
If you would like to add a seminar, make sure your supervisor approved it first, then send me an email at [daniel.schmitz@igp.uu.se](mailto:daniel.schmitz@igp.uu.se).
If you prefer to open a pull request, make sure I can verify you status as a PhD student at IGP, preferably by adding your university email address or displaying it on your profile.
